            <h2>Why We Created Clean Bites</h2>
            Clean Bites was founded by four individuals-Panicia, Paquita Melawi, Melfanny Leono, and Irene Carl Lewis —who share a passion for healthy living and balanced nutrition. Each of us has faced our own challenges when it comes to finding meals that are not only delicious but also meet specific dietary needs such as Keto, Vegan, and Gluten-Free. We realized that many others were struggling with the same issues, and we wanted to provide a solution.
            Our goal in creating Clean Bites was to make it easier for people to embrace a healthier lifestyle without sacrificing the joy of eating. We believe that everyone deserves access to recipes and guidance that are both nutritious and flavorful. Clean Bites is our way of sharing this journey with others and helping people feel confident in their dietary choices, no matter their preferences or restrictions.
