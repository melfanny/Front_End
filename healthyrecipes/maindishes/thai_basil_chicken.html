                <h1>Thai Basil Chicken</h1>
                <p>Fragrant Thai Basil Chicken is simple, fast and flavorful! Perfect for weeknight dinners, ready to
                    serve in under 30
                    minutes.

                    This Thai Basil Chicken stir fry is couldn’t be any easier! It’s common on most Thai restaurant
                    menus (aka pad krapow
                    gai) but can easily be made at home. This is the kind of food I am craving lately, tasty and
                    satisfying but doesn’t take
                    much effort.

                    Using ground chicken (or ground turkey) makes this recipe even faster. You could certainly chop up
                    whole chicken thighs
                    or breasts if you prefer, or use crumbled tofu. Traditionally this is made with Thai holy basil
                    which is also known as
                    tulsi basil, and is available fresh, at some Asian Markets. Thai basil is easier to come by and
                    works great in this
                    recipe. And yes, you can use regular Italian basil! TIP: When using regular basil, I like to add
                    just a pinch of ground
                    anise to the stir fry. If you love it spicy definitely go for the red Thai chilies! Fresno chilies
                    have great flavor and
                    though not as spicy as the Thai chilies, they still have a good kick!
