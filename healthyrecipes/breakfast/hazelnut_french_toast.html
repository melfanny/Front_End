                <h1>Baked French Toast with Caramelized Pears and Hazelnuts</h1>
                <p>Baked French Toast with Pears and Hazelnuts– a delicious fall-inspired brunch recipe.
                    <br><br>
                    In France, French toast is called pain perdu, which literally means “lost bread”. The unused,
                    leftover and stale bits of
                    bread are soaked in a batter of cream and eggs, and then fried, transforming the bread into a
                    delicious hearty meal.
                    <br><br>
                    Nothing is wasted. This French toast recipe is baked instead of fried and can be assembled the day
                    before, which makes
                    it easy if you are having guests over. It’s a cozy and decadent recipe featuring fall pears
                    caramelized in butter and
                    maple syrup with toasted hazelnuts and real vanilla beans. It’s perfect for the holidays or a
                    special occasion brunch.

                    <ul>

                <div class="recipe-content">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                        <li>Toast hazelnuts for 10-15 minutes, let cool, and gently crush using a rolling pin.</li>
                        <li>Split the vanilla bean, scrape out seeds, and place directly in a small saucepan with 2 1/2
                            cups of
                            half-and-half. Add the remaining vanilla pod. Warm up the half-and-half and vanilla on
                            medium heat, stirring
                            occasionally, until almost to a boil. Turn the heat off and let it cool and seep for 20-30
                            minutes.</li>
                        <li>Slice the pears. Melt the butter in a skillet and sauté pears on medium heat until golden,
                            about 8-10 minutes.
                            Add 1 tablespoon of maple syrup. Simmer for a few more minutes, allowing them to caramelize.
                            Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Cut the bread into 1/2 inch slices. In a medium bowl, beat eggs, salt, spices, orange zest,
                            and 3 tablespoons of
                            maple syrup. When the half-and-half has cooled, remove the vanilla pod, and add a little at
                            a time into the egg
                            mixture, mixing it together. (Do NOT add hot cream to the egg mixture, as it may cause your
                            eggs to curdle.
                            Either let the cream cool or temper the eggs by adding just a little warm cream at a time,
                            mixing in between so
                            the eggs gradually warm up.)</li>
                        <li>Generously butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer the bread, hazelnuts, and caramelized
                            pears, pouring all the
                            buttery syrup from the pan evenly over the bread. Pour the batter over, using a spatula to
                            ensure it goes into
                            all the cracks and crevices. Let sit for at least 30 minutes so the bread can soak up the
                            batter, or refrigerate
                            overnight.</li>
                        <li>Right before placing in the oven, drizzle the top with 1 more tablespoon of maple syrup and
                            sprinkle with a
                            pinch of cardamom.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes until puffed and golden. If your layers measure higher than two
                            inches, you may need to
                            bake longer. Check the middle to see if all the liquid is cooked. The true test is if it
                            puffs up; it is done.
                        </li>
                        <li>Melt small dots of butter over the top and serve with warm maple syrup.</li>
                    </ol>
