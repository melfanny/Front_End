                <div class="recipe-content">
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Draw an 8-9″ circle on a piece of parchment paper and
                            place it on a baking
                            sheet. Flip the parchment so the writing is on the underside.</li>
                        <li>Separate the eggs. Cold eggs separate better, but room-temperature egg whites whip better.
                            Separate the eggs
                            while cold, then let the whites come to room temperature. To speed this up, place the bowl
                            of whites over a bowl
                            of warm water.</li>
                        <li>In a stand mixer, whip the egg whites on medium until foamy. Add cream of tartar. If using
                            vinegar instead, add
                            it later with the vanilla.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add sugar one tablespoon at a time, whisking between each addition until the sugar
                            is fully
                            incorporated. Increase the mixer speed and beat until the whites are glossy and stiff.</li>
                        <li>Test the mixture by rubbing between your fingers; there should be no sugar granules. If it's
                            still gritty,
                            continue beating.</li>
                        <li>Once the peaks are stiff, add the pinch of salt and vanilla (if using) and whip for another
                            30 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Shape the Pavlova: Gently scoop the mixture onto the parchment. Spread it in a circle with a
                            cake knife,
                            creating a slight indent in the center with raised edges.</li>
                        <li>Bake: Place the tray in the oven, then reduce the temperature to 200°F (95°C). Bake for 120
                            minutes or until the
                            Pavlova is dry to the touch. Turn off the oven and allow it to cool inside for at least 2
                            hours or overnight.
                        </li>
                        <li>For the whipped cream: Whip together the cream, sugar, and zest to medium-soft peaks. Fold
                            in a tablespoon of
                            jam or lemon curd if desired.</li>
                        <li>Assemble: Just before serving, top the cooled Pavlova with whipped cream and fresh berries.
                            Serve immediately!
