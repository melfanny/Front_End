            <h1> Gluten-Free Diet: Necessary for Everyone? </h1>

        <div class="artikel-container">
            <p>In recent years, the gluten-free diet has gained popularity, with many people adopting it in the belief that it promotes better health. But is this diet necessary for everyone? While it is crucial for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, not everyone needs to avoid gluten.</p><br>

            <h2>What is Gluten?</h2>
            <p>Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It helps foods maintain their shape, acting as a glue that holds food together. While most people can digest gluten without issues, it can cause serious health problems for some individuals.</p> <br>
            
            <h2>Who Needs a Gluten-Free Diet?</h2>
            <p>For those with celiac disease, consuming gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the small intestine, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating, and malnutrition. People with non-celiac gluten sensitivity may experience similar symptoms without the intestinal damage.</p><br>
            
            <h2>Is Gluten-Free Healthy for Everyone?</h2>
            <p>For people without gluten-related disorders, a gluten-free diet is not necessarily healthier. In fact, gluten-free products are often processed and can lack essential nutrients such as fiber, iron, and B vitamins. Over-reliance on processed gluten-free foods can lead to nutrient deficiencies.</p><br>
            
            <h2>How to Safely Follow a Gluten-Free Diet</h2>
            <p>If you need or choose to follow a gluten-free diet, it's important to focus on naturally gluten-free foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and gluten-free whole grains like quinoa and rice. Ensure you are getting adequate fiber, vitamins, and minerals by including a variety of foods in your diet.</p><br>
            
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>A gluten-free diet is essential for those with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. However, for others, it may not provide health benefits and could potentially lead to nutrient deficiencies. Always consult with a healthcare professional before making significant dietary changes.</p><br>
